// Using the above function as a guide, author the four action functions needed
// to handle the four action types you just authored. These functions should receive
// two parameters: endpoint and key.
// The endpoint will be either one endpoint or an array of endpoint.
// The key will be a string. Your filter should sort out by 'homeworld', 'film', 'starship'
// You will pass the endpoint and keys in the appropiate function calls in the people.js component
// Use the following names: filterWorlds, filterFilms, filterStarships, stateReset

// 'stateReset' does not need any parameters and payload.

// The purpose of these actions (and their reducers) is to make it possible for a user,
// to sort out all of the characters by similar worlds, films, and starships.
// For example: If Luke Skywalker appears in movies 1, 2, 3, then the films filter should
// filter all the characters that appear on any of those fimls.
